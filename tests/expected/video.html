The cat struggles a bit but eventually manages to squeeze its entire body through to the other side.
The video then transitions to a scene from a movie, showing a man, possibly a character from &quot;The Terminator&quot; franchise, similarly squeezing through a metal grate or fence, with a determined expression.
The juxtaposition implies the cat is as determined and perhaps as 'unstoppable' as the Terminator character."/><meta property="og:image" content="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/adBW0ej_460s.jpg"/><meta property="og:image:alt" content="<9gag_thumbnail>"/><meta name="theme-color" content="\#FFFFFF"/><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"/><link type="application/json+oembed" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/oembed?post_url=https%3A%2F%2F9gag.com%2Fgag%2FadBW0ej&title=%5B%F0%9F%98%82+Humor%5D+Catinator+1000"/><meta property="og:video" content="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/adBW0ej_460sv.mp4"/><meta property="og:video:secure_url" content="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/adBW0ej_460sv.mp4"/></head></html>
